Synapse allows you to seamlessly integrate and manage AI agents in your Laravel applications. Inspired by Langchain and Laravel Saloon, this package simplifies AI agent creation and management, giving you the tools to run them at scale.

## Features

- Supports multiple AI integrations, including OpenAI, Ollama and Claude.
- Easily extendable agent lifecycle with customizable hooks.
- Memory options for agents: temporary (CollectionMemory) or persistent (DatabaseMemory).
- Use Laravel's Blade system to create dynamic prompts.
- Build complex `few-shot` agent prompts with message tagging.
- Extend functionality by creating custom tools that can interact with agents. Tools can even make additional API calls or invoke other agents.
- Prebuilt agents available for quick and easy use with popular integrations like OpenAI.
