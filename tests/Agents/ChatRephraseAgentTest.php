Follow this with strength training exercises, such as weightlifting or bodyweight exercises like squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and pull-ups, to build muscle and enhance metabolism. Finish with 10-15 minutes of stretching or yoga to improve flexibility, reduce the risk of injury, and aid muscle recovery.
