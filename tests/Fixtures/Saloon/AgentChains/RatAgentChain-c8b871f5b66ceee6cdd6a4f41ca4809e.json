First and foremost, diet plays a critical role in heart health. Reducing the intake of saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol-rich foods is advisable, as these can contribute to plaque buildup in arteries. Instead, focus on eating a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins to keep your heart healthy.\\\\n\\\\nRegular physical activity is also crucial for maintaining a healthy heart. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise each week, combined with muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days a week.\\\\n\\\\nAvoiding tobacco in any form is one of the most significant steps you can take to protect your heart. Smoking and the use of tobacco products increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. If you smoke, seek help to quit as soon as possible.\\\\n\\\\nMonitoring your health with regular check-ups can help catch and address potential heart issues before they become severe. This includes keeping an eye on blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar, especially if you have a family history of heart disease.\\\\n\\\\nLastly, managing stress and ensuring adequate sleep each night contribute to overall heart health. Engage in stress-reducing activities that you enjoy and aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night to promote heart health.\\\"\\n}\\n```\",\n        \"refusal\": null\n      },\n      \"logprobs\": null,\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 145,\n    \"completion_tokens\": 291,\n    \"total_tokens\": 436,\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_83975a045a\"\n}\n"
