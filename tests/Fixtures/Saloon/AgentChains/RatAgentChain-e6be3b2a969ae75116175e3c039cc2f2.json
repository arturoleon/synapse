Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise each week. Activities could include walking, cycling, swimming, or sprinting. Exercise helps reduce hypertension, lower cholesterol, and keep body weight under control.\\n\\nSecondly, diet plays a crucial role in heart health. Incorporating heart-healthy foods into your diet can enhance cardiovascular function and reduce risk factors. Focus on eating a variety of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins such as fish and legumes, and nuts and seeds. Limit the intake of saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, salt (sodium), and added sugars. Opt for cooking methods that require less fat, such as boiling, baking, or steaming rather than frying.\\n\\nAdditionally, managing stress and ensuring adequate sleep each night are vital components of heart health. Chronic stress and poor sleep patterns can lead to increased heart rate and blood pressure, potentially causing long-term harm to the heart. Employ relaxation techniques such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, or yoga. Strive for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.\\n\\nRegularly monitoring health metrics and consulting with healthcare professionals are also crucial. Keep track of your blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and body weight. Regular check-ups will help in early identification and management of any potential heart issues. Quitting smoking and limiting alcohol intake are also beneficial for maintaining a healthy heart.\\n\\nBy consistently applying these strategies, you can significantly improve and maintain your heart health over time.\\\"\\n}\\n```\",\n        \"refusal\": null\n      },\n      \"logprobs\": null,\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 81,\n    \"completion_tokens\": 362,\n    \"total_tokens\": 443,\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_83975a045a\"\n}\n"
