Incorporate a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains into your meals. Focus on eating lean proteins and limit your intake of unhealthy fats, sodium, and added sugars. This approach can help manage your body weight, reduce cholesterol, and lower blood pressure, all of which are beneficial for heart health.\\n\\nSecondly, exercise is crucial for maintaining a healthy heart. The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week. Regular physical activity helps strengthen the heart muscle, improves blood circulation, and can help you maintain a healthy weight.\\n\\nAdditionally, lifestyle modifications are necessary for optimal heart health. If you smoke, quitting is one of the most powerful steps you can take. Managing stress through techniques like yoga, meditation, or regular relaxation can also have profound benefits on your cardiovascular health. Limiting alcohol intake is recommended as it can have a direct impact on heart conditions.\\n\\nLastly, routine health screenings are vital. Regular visits to your healthcare provider for blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes screenings can help detect problems early and facilitate timely intervention. Discussing your family's health history with your doctor can also provide insights into your personal risk factors and guide preventive measures.\\n\\nBy implementing these strategies, you can improve your heart health significantly and decrease the risk of heart-related diseases.\\\"\\n}\\n```\",\n        \"refusal\": null\n      },\n      \"logprobs\": null,\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 525,\n    \"completion_tokens\": 314,\n    \"total_tokens\": 839,\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_eae715ec6a\"\n}\n"
