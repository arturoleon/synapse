# Prompts
For a detailed explanation of how prompts work please see the [prompts section under agents](/agents/prompts). 

Synapse comes with some prebuilt Agent prompts as well as prompt synipts that you can include in your own prompt views. All prompts can included using the blade `@include` tag and referencing synapse ie: `@include('synapse::Parts.OutputSchema')`
