# Prompts

For a detailed explanation of how prompts work, please refer to the [Prompts section under Agents](/agents/prompts).

Synapse includes several prebuilt agent prompts and prompt parts that can be integrated into your custom prompt views. You can include these prompts using Blade's `@include` directive by referencing Synapse, for example: `@include('synapse::Parts.OutputSchema')`.
